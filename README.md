# Naive_Bayes Algorithm for Classification
The implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm
This project ia an implementation of the Naive Bayes Algorithm on categorical data. Naive Bayes is a generative model that makes prediction based on joint probability distribution. It assumes features of the dataset are independent.
A smoothing technique known as Laplacian correction is used for data combinations that might not appear in the dataset. The Laplacian correction smoothes the probability with a pseudo-count ot 0.1
